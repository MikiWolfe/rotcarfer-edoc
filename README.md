# Code Refactor
## Organizing code but not changing what it does.

We are trying to accoplish to tidy up the code of the client's website.  Their exisitng code is useable, but needs to be a bit more organzied and more accessible for all users.  We are adding semantic HTML elements and helping 

We are keeping the desktop viewing so ultimately nothing with the design of the website has changed. The elements, ids, and classes of the Html and CSS code was changed and organized.
