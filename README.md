# Code Refactor

## Organizing code but not changing what it does

We are trying to accoplish to tidy up the code of the client's website. Their exisitng code is useable, but needs to be a bit more organzied and more accessible for all users. We are adding semantic HTML elements and attempting to make the webpage work with screen readers. 

We are keeping the desktop viewing so ultimately nothing with the design of the website has changed. The elements, ids, and classes of the Html and CSS code was changed and organized.

Things that I learned from this project: 
-Patience is key. 
-How to turn wet code into dry code
-Baby steps are still progress
