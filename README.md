# Code Refactor

## Organizing code but not changing what it does

We are trying to accomplish to tidy up the code of the client's website. Their existing code is useable, but needs to be a bit more organized and more accessible for all users. We are adding semantic HTML elements and attempting to make the webpage work with screen readers. 

We are keeping the desktop viewing so ultimately nothing with the design of the website has changed. The elements, ids, and classes of the Html and CSS code was changed and organized.

Comments have been added to explain sections of HTML and CSS code so others can follow the path of how the code was organized. 

Code blocks of CSS were reorganized and consolidated into classes as to be applied to everything that fell within that class.

IDs are uses sparingly and only when to override the class because of priority.  

Things that I learned from this project: 
-Patience is key. 

-How to turn wet code into dry code

-Baby steps are still progress
